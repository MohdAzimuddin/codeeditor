# Personal Code Editor

A simple, interactive online code editor where users can write and test HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly in their browser. The editor features an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript input area, with live output displayed in an iframe. Users can clear the content in each section and reset the output easily.

## Features

- **Live Preview**: The editor updates the output in real-time as you type or edit the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.
- **Clear Buttons**: Each input field (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) has a corresponding clear button to reset its content.
- **Responsive Layout**: The design is responsive and adjusts for different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobiles).
- **Customizable Styling**: The buttons are conditionally styled with different background colors for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript sections.
  
## Structure

The project consists of the following files:

1. **index.html**: The main HTML structure for the editor.
2. **style.css**: The stylesheet that defines the visual design and layout of the editor.
3. **script.js**: JavaScript file that handles the logic for updating the iframe, clearing the inputs, and managing button events.

## How It Works

1. **Editor Area**: Users can write their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in three separate text areas.
    - HTML: Written in the `textarea` with the `id="html-markup"`.
    - CSS: Written in the `textarea` with the `id="css-style"`.
    - JavaScript: Written in the `textarea` with the `id="js-script"`.
   
2. **Live Preview**: The code from the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript text areas is compiled together and displayed inside an iframe. The output is updated as the user types.

3. **Clear Buttons**: Each input field has a "Clear" button to remove the content. Additionally, there is a "Clear Output" button that clears the live preview.

## How To Use

1. **Write Code**: Start writing your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript in their respective text areas.
2. **See Results**: The live preview will automatically update in the iframe below the editor.
3. **Clear Sections**: You can clear any section (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) by clicking the respective "Clear" button.
4. **Clear Output**: Clicking the "Clear Output" button will remove the displayed output in the iframe.

## Responsive Design

- **Desktop**: The editor adapts to large screen sizes with a horizontal layout.
- **Tablet/Small Screens**: The input areas are wrapped and resized to fit smaller screens. The iframe is also adjusted to not exceed the screen width.
  
## Important Notes

- **FontAwesome Icons**: The editor uses FontAwesome icons to represent HTML, CSS, and JavaScript buttons. Icons are styled to match the respective language (HTML = red, CSS = blue, JS = yellow).
- **Code Injection**: The live output is generated by injecting the user's code into an iframe, which is then displayed. This means any errors in the user's code will show up in the output area.
- **Iframe Security**: The code executed in the iframe is sandboxed by default, meaning it wonâ€™t affect the main page but will run within the iframe context.
